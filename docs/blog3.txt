Perhaps it was a foreign language, like Italian or German. Or maybe
it was a graphics editor, like Photoshop. Or a cooking technique or
woodworking or an exercise routine. I want you to remember that
feeling when you finally got it: the lightbulb moment. When things
went from blurry to crystal clear, as you mastered the table saw or
understood the difference between masculine and feminine nouns
in French. How did it feel? Pretty amazing, right?

Now I want you to travel back a little bit further in your memory to
right before you learned your new skill. How did that feel? Probably
slightly intimidating and maybe a little bit frustrating, right? At one
point, we all did not know the things that we know now, and that’s
totally OK; we all start somewhere. Learning new material is an
exciting adventure, especially if you are looking to learn the subject
efficiently.

I teach a lot of beginner coding classes. The students who take my
classes have often tried teaching themselves subjects like HTML or
JavaScript by reading blog posts or copying and pasting code, but
they haven’t been able to truly master the material that will allow
them to code their desired outcome. And because they don’t truly
grasp the ins and outs of certain coding topics, they can’t write pow‐
erful code or debug their own work because they don’t really under‐
stand what is happening.
